# Blog Application API

This project is a backend REST API for a blog application developed using Java Spring Boot. The API allows for CRUD operations on users, posts, roles, and comments. Authentication and authorization are implemented using Spring Security.

## Technologies Used

- Java Spring Boot - For the backend framework
- Spring Security - For handling authentication and authorization
- Spring Data JPA - For database operations
- MySQL - As the database

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure with packages dedicated to various layers and responsibilities.

## Key Packages

- config: Contains configuration files for Spring Security and other settings.
- controllers: Contains REST controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses.
- dto: Data Transfer Objects for carrying data between layers.
- entities: Defines the data models for User, Role, Post, and Content.
- exceptions: Custom exception handling for the application.
- payloads: Contains response and request payloads such as ApiResponse and PostResponse.
- repositories: Repository interfaces for database interactions using Spring Data JPA.
- security: Manages authentication and authorization configurations.
- service: Service layer for business logic.
- util: Utility classes for common functions.

## Entity Classes

- User: Represents the user entity with fields such as id, name, email, etc.
- Role: Represents different roles (e.g., admin, user).
- Post: Represents a blog post with fields such as id, title, content, etc.

## Getting Started

# Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later
- Maven for dependency management
- MySQL server

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blog-app-api.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   cd blog-app-api

3. Configure MySQL database connection in application.properties:

-  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/blog_db
-  spring.datasource.username=your_username
-  spring.datasource.password=your_password
-  spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

4. Build and run the application:

   mvn spring-boot:run

## Usage

Use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints. Authentication is required for secured endpoints; use JWT tokens for authorization.
